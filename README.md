This project is a simple chat application built using WebSockets, created as a learning experience to deepen my understanding of real-time communication in web development.

As I had little prior experience with WebSockets, I aimed to explore their functionality and potential. The application consists of a server that facilitates connections between clients, allowing them to communicate with each other in real time. Users can enter a chat room, send messages, and receive notifications when others join or leave the conversation.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into WebSocket implementation, client-server interactions, and event-driven programming, which are essential skills for developing responsive and interactive web applications.
